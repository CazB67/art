## Description
This is a website I created to show case my friend's art. Eventually it will be a place where customers can buy her art and or request commissions via a contact form. It is a work in progress that will hopefully soon be completed and hosted in her own domain.

 The following URL shows what it looks like so far - https://cazb67.github.io/art/
